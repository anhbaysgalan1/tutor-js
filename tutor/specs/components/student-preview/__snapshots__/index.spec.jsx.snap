        Student dashboard

      <p>
        The dashboard gives students an overview of the course, assignments, progress, and performance. Students can see when assignments are due, start current assignments, review past work, and access their textbook. The student Performance Forecast shows students their performance within each section of the textbook, highlights their weaker areas, and lets them practice on their own.
